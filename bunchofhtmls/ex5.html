                Strict equality compares two values for equality.
                <br>Neither value is implicitly converted to some other value before being compared.
                <br>If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal.
                <br>Otherwise, if the values have the same type and are not numbers, they're considered equal if they have the same value.
                <br>Finally, if both values are numbers, they're considered equal if they're both not NaN and are the same value, or if one is +0 and one is -0.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>
                !== not equal value or not equal type
            </li>
            <ul>
                    return true if the operands are not equal and/or not of the same type.
